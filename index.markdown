We are working toward better conceptual understanding, algorithmic techniques, and policies to make AI more safe and socially beneficial. Our research is interdisciplinary but emphasizes how humans and AI systems interact in the contexts of value learning, incentives, recommendation, debugging, and policy. We are headed by [Dylan Hadfield-Menell](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dhm/) and work in the [Embodied Intelligence Group](https://ei.csail.mit.edu/) at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)
