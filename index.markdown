Our focus is to better align the development of AI with human interests and values headed by [Dylan Hadfield-Menell](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dhm/). We are working in the [Embodied Intelligence Group](https://ei.csail.mit.edu/) at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) to build the conceptual understanding and algorithmic techniques that will be needed for more trustworthy AI. Our research is interdisciplinary but emphasizes how humans and AI systems interact in the contexts of value learning, incentives, recommendation, debugging, and policy.
