    <strong>Dylan Hadfield-Menell</strong>, dhm[at]csail[dot]mit[dot]edu, <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/dhm/">Website</a>
    <br>
    Dylan is an assistant professor on the faculty of Artificial Intelligence and Decision-Making in the EECS Department and Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His research focuses on the problem of agent alignment: the challenge of identifying behaviors that are consistent with the goals of another actor or group of actors. His work aims to identify algorithmic solutions to alignment problems that arise from groups of AI systems, principal-agent pairs (i.e., human-robot teams), and societal oversight of ML systems.
